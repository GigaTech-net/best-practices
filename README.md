# Welcome to GigaTECH

You've reached the [GigaTECH](https://gigatech.net) best practice repository. This is our home for our opinions on how to do a variety of things that allow us to create creative solutions for a complex world. Our philosophy for software development and solution delivery is rooted in 3 main concepts, automation, collaboration and learning. As a [SDVOSB](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/service-disabled-veteran-owned-small-businesses-program), we use these concepts to deliver cutting edge solutions to our clients while positively impacting veterans and their families.
