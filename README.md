# Welcome to GigaTECH

You've reached the [GigaTECH](https://gigatech.net) best practice repository. This is our home for our opinions on how to do a variety of things that allow us to create creative solutions for a complex world. Our philosophy for software development and solution delivery is rooted in 3 main concepts, automation, collaboration and learning. As a [SDVOSB](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/service-disabled-veteran-owned-small-businesses-program), we use these concepts to deliver cutting edge solutions to our clients while positively impacting veterans and their families.

## Best Practices

We employ best practices across our projects and repositories. Individual projects may have their own best practices that supercede these.

### GitHub

While there isn't one true answer for github practices, at GigaTECH, we start with these practices and tailor as needed.

- Don't push straight to master (use protected branches)
- Do use branch naming conventions
- Don't commit secrets to source
- Do commit related changes
- Don't commit dependencies
- Do commit often
- Don't commit local/individual configuration
- Do create a good gitignore file
- Don't commit half done work
- Do stay up to date
- Don't change published history
- Do you a workflow that your team agrees to
- Do perform peer reviews on PRs
- Do test before you commit
- Do write good commit messages
- see [GitHub Best Practices](https://resources.github.com/videos/github-best-practices/) for general information.
